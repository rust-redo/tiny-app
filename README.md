# tiny-app

`tiny-app` is a collection of tiny applications or libraries implemented in Rust. 

## Why

Just like [rust-by-practice](https://github.com/sunface/rust-by-practice) and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), `tiny-app` aims to sharpen rookies' Rust skills. The main difference is that `tiny-app` focuses on how to implement a tiny application in Rust while the other two focus on how to beat the Rust compiler via plenty of code snippets. Exercises in `rust-by-practice` and `rustlings` are recommended to be done before you start the journey in `tiny-app`.

## What will you learn

> Every collection's source code in `tiny-app` contains comprehensive comments, it's easy to read. 

- A deeper understanding of Rust syntax and engineering.
- A implementation overview of each application.


## Collections

- [x] [guess number](./guess_number/README.md) `game` `repl`
- [ ] [file tree]() `fs` `command`
- [ ] [text editor]()  `editor` `terminal`
- [ ] [calculator]() `repl` `compilation`
- [ ] [greedy snake]() `game` `wasm` `robot`
- [ ] [linkedlist]() `structure` `algorithm`

More collections are on the way...
