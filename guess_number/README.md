# guess number

This is a demo app from [Programming a Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html), it receives users' input numbers and checks whether they are equal with internal random number. 

Let's start with this app to warm up before we move on to the rest apps.
